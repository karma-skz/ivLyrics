## Installation

### 1. Install Spotify

The latest version installed from the official Spotify website may not be compatible with Spicetify. Install a compatible version using the methods below.

If you already have Spotify installed, please uninstall it first.

#### Windows
Open PowerShell and run the following command:
```powershell
iex "& { $(iwr -useb 'https://amd64fox.github.io/Rollback-Spotify/run.ps1') } -version 1.2.76.298-x64"
```

#### macOS
Open Terminal and run the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetfir3/TBZify/main/tbzify.sh) -v 1.2.76.298
```

#### Manual Download
- Windows: https://loadspot.pages.dev/?os=win&build=release&search=1.2.76.298
- macOS: https://loadspot.pages.dev/?os=mac&build=release&search=1.2.76.298

### 2. Install Spicetify

Skip this step if you already have Spicetify installed.

Do not run as administrator.

#### Windows
Open PowerShell and run the following command:
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### macOS / Linux
Open Terminal and run the following command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/cli/main/install.sh | sh

When prompted to install Marketplace during installation, enter Y. Using it with the FullScreen extension from Marketplace provides a better experience.
